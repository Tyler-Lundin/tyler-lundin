# Tyler Lundin – Fullstack Developer / Builder of Cool Sh*t

Hey — I’m Tyler. Freelance dev, gearhead, and serial experimenter. I build clean, no-BS web apps using modern stacks like Next.js, Supabase, and TypeScript. I’m not here for corporate fluff — I like solving real problems, fast.

I work from wherever I am — sometimes a driveway, sometimes a couch, sometimes the front seat of my car. The code still ships.

## 🧠 Philosophy
- **Simplicity > cleverness.** Readable code wins.
- **Ship it.** You don’t learn by waiting.
- **Iterate loud.** I don’t hoard ideas — I build them.
- **Talk straight.** No fake it ‘til you make it, just make it.

## ⚙️ Current Stack
- **Frameworks:** Next.js 15, React Server Components  
- **Backend:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, Edge Functions  
- **Auth:** Custom Supabase + cookie-based SSR auth  
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui  
- **Dev Tools:** Vercel, GitHub, Cursor, & Nvim  

## 🔨 Projects
- **Slot Fox** – Clean booking widget builder - Inspired by nothing.  
- **[LundinVision](https://lundinvision.com)** – My dad / sister's optometry site. Yes, I make sites for the fam too.
- **[Yardscapes](https://willows-yardscapes.com)** - My Step Dad's landscaping site. Si, para mi familia.
- **[Portfolio](https://www.tylerlundin.me)** - My personal site to act as my sandbox
- **TBA** – Working on a top-down action game inspired by 33 Immortals + Tarkov. Think chaos, loot, and permadeath.

## 🧰 Hardware
- 💻 MacBook Pro M1 – daily driver, reliable as hell  
- 💻 Surface Pro X – ARM experiments + travel dev  
- ⬛️ Velka 3 w/ RTX 4060 – for game dev and Windows hellscapes  
- 🧠 Brain (still patching bugs, occasional logic loops)
