### random ideas that I won't do
- Home Page that 'pops'
- Full Screen clean menu with mini animations
- Design a 'Projects' Page after homescreen and nav are complete
- Avoid doing a single page app for best performance aka react-router time :)
- Projects will be displayed through an iframe to the real site. keep 'projects' SIMPLE to allow good performance

### About page ideas (type as I think)
- public journal (blog)
- my story 
- links to github and linkedin 
- snapchat and instagram and youtube if I ever get on that idea of mine :)
- photo library ? idk
- interactivity somehow!
