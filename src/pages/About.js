          In 2021 I lost my best friend Amanda to suicide.  Through the grief I am learning how fragile and important life and love are.
          I wanted to put myself in a better position in life so I started on the path of a Self-Taught Web Developer / Designer.
          I keep my life simple now, I go to the gym, spend time with my family, and work on improving my Development / Design skills
          every day.  Life will never stop moving for anything or anyone, but in the off chance I get to see her again, I want her to 
          be proud and happy of my life.

          Amanda took her life, after two years of loving, fighting, laughing,
          crying, happiness, and all the real stuff of life, she left.  I think about her
          every single day, and it pushes me in everything.  I am not a religious person,
          I feel we will never see each other again but I hope we do.

          Months after she left, I drove out to Washington DC with my awesome brother Jacob.
          I was open with him about how the grieving process made me feel.  I told him I had
          cosidered leaving the world myself in search of her.  He made up a scenario in my head
          with some 'younger brother wise words'.  "What if when you die, you repeat this life over and over. . .
          You live through all that you just went through over and over forever." Hilarious but it worked.

          Going to the gym is what I did. I went a lot, not a lot, but A LOT.  I isolated myself from
          the world outside AND inside of work.  I had music drowning out the world for me almost constantly.
          I went back to playing video games too much like I did when I was a little kid but I needed to.

          During all this I had picked up an old passion of mine from when I was in highschool, programming.
          I started studying at work on all my breaks, trying to teach myself how to become a software engineer.
          I realized that is a big step from working a nightshift factory job after a few months.
          I switched my focus over to an even OLDER passion of mine coming from when I was just 15 years old.
          I picked up Web Development in my brain and started watching tutorial after tutorial.
          <br/><br/>
          I started soley with the basics, HTML and CSS.  I felt so rusty but picked up the basics within a week or two.
          I started on Javascript for a month before I found out about something called a framework. REACT JS!
          It is an amazing tool, it is what I use to develop all my projects.  Since September of 2021 I have committed 
          1 - 10 hours nearly every day to keep learning.

          December is hard while being alone.  She left 4 days after my birthday, 8 months prior to December.  December 04, 1998 is the month she was born,
          aka her Birthday.  December 25th as most know, is Christmas, and one I would be spending alone with my cats.  Just days after that is New Years Eve,
          whom I had no one to spend time with.  Just me, myself, and I for all these days so I did something crazy.
          I quit my job without a notice.  Amanda always wanted me to quit, and I really wish I would have to be able to spend time with her.
          I was being mistreated in my mind, and I needed to focus on my health and my life.  I stopped showing up one day without saying goodbye
          to anyone.  It shocked everyone as I was friends (or friendly) with everyone.  I felt bad for leaving them like that
          but it was to make a point to myself.  I can't live an unhealthy like like that ever again.  No more wasting time for 'good money'.
          Time with family, myself, and my passions is what will give me what I am looking for.  I hold it as a promise to Amanda in hopes
          I do see her again, I want to be able to share a GOOD story instead of a sad, valueless story of my life.
          I will keep getting up, and I will do better for that promise to the both of us.

          <br/>
          I left Utah after living there for 15+ years for Spokane, WA.  I decided to move in with my family
          as I have been focusing extremely hard on keeping my mental and physical health in great condition.
          I have been out in Washington.  Every day I have been here I have been feeling better and better.
          I have been working on my Web Development skills constantly, day in and day out.  I go to the gym every
          (non-rest) day.  I am eating extremely well, being apart of my siblings and parents lifes.
          Turns out my younger brother (5yo) Easton had no idea I was his brother.  He thought I was a friend üòÜ
          I am doing really well and I want to keep this going.  My goal is to have a job or be freelancing before
          my birthday.  4 Days after is Amanda 1 year, and when I 'talk' to her, I want to give good news.  She may not be listening
          but it feels nice to speak to her on occasion.
          <br/><br/>
          Rest in peace Amanda
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Love and Happiness to all,
          <br/>
